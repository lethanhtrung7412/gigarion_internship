# This is all the content that I have learn about Docker

Docker is a platform that help building, running and managing application by virtualizing the OS of the computer that 
is installed and running

About Docker concept:
- Images: is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes evereything needed to run a piece of 
software, including the code, library, dependencies,...I related to it like a snapshot of a file system and all the 
components to run a software. Images are immutable
- Containers: I related to this as a bucket that store a complete enviroment, including the application and all the 
dependences. The Docker Container it also like a virtual enviroment that you can run your code, but not like the VM,
where it require less resouce. Container are mutable
- Dockerfile: is a file that contains instruction for building an application enviroment. We use this to create a
docker images
