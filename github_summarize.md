### This is the summarize about all the content that I have learn about Git

Git is a version controll manager that help user to keep track of their code

Some simple command that I have learn:
- git status: check for  any change that happen
- git add . || git add <path to file>:add the change into the staging area
- git commit -m "Your message": confirm all the change that in the staging area and save it
- git push: push all the commit code the online repository
- git pull: get all the change from the online repository and merge into local repo
- git branch <new branch name>: create a new branch, like a new version of the main repo
- git merge <branch you want to merge>: combine the change that you make from other one to the branch that you currently on
